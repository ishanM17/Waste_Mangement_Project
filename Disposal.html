            <img class="content-img" src="./images/disposal_1.png" alt="hazardous_img1">
            <p class="content-text">Garbage arising from human or animal activities, that is abandoned as unwanted and useless is referred as solid waste. However, waste can be categorized based on materials such as paper, plastic, glass, metal and organic waste. Solid waste disposal must be managed systematically to ensure environmental best practices. Solid waste disposal and management is a critical aspect of environmental hygiene and it needs to be incorporated into environmental planning. Solid waste disposal and management includes planning, administrative, financial, engineering and legal functions.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Improper disposal of municipal solid waste can create unsanitary conditions, and these conditions in turn lead to pollution of the environment. Diseases can be spread by rodents and insects. The tasks of solid waste disposal management are complex technical challenges. They can also pose a wide variety of economic, administrative and social problems that must be changed and solved.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Here are the methods of solid waste disposal and management:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solid Waste Open Burning - </strong>Solid waste open burning is not the perfect method in the present scenario.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sea Dumping Process - </strong>This sea dumping process can be carried out only in coastal cities. This is very costly procedure and not environment friendly</li>
                    <li><strong>Solid wastes sanitary landfills - </strong>Solid wastes sanitary landfills process is simple, clean and effective. In this procedure, layers are compressed with some mechanical equipment and covered with earth, levelled, and compacted. A deep trench of 3 to 5 m is excavated and micro-organisms act on the organic matter and degrade them.
                        In this procedure, refuse depth is generally limited to 2m. Facultative bacteria hydrolyse complex organic matter into simpler water soluble organics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incineration method - </strong>Incineration method is suitable for combustible refuse. High operation costs and construction are involved in this procedure. This method would be suited in crowded cities where sites for land filling are not available. It can be used to reduce the volume of solid wastes for land filling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Composting process - </strong>Composting process is similar to sanitary land-filling and it is popular in developing countries. Decomposable organic matter is separated and composted in this procedure. Yields are stable end products and good soil conditioners. They can be used as a base for fertilizers.Two methods have been used in this process: a.Open Window Composting, b. Mechanical Composting </li>
                    <li><strong>Disposal by Ploughing into the fields - </strong>Disposal by ploughing into the fields are not commonly used. These disposals are not environment friendly in general.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disposal by hog feeding - </strong>Disposal by hog feeding is not general procedure in India. Garbage disposal into sewers including BOD and TSS increases by 20-30%. Refuse is ground well in grinders and then fed into sewers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salvaging procedure - </strong>Materials such as metal, paper, glass, rags, certain types of plastic and so on can be salvaged, recycled, and reused.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salvaging procedure - </strong>Biodegradable wastes are converted to compost and recycling can be done whenever possible. Hazardous wastes can be disposed using suitable methods.</li>
                </ul></p>
            
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Linear economy: </h2>

            <p class="content-text">Linear economy follows the take-make-dispose strategy. “Take-Make-Dispose” is a procedure that helps Linear Economy work smoothly and manage collected Industrial and Consumer Waste. Take-Make-Dispose is the collection, production, and disposal of different products or materials after distribution. This procedure takes a lot of effort, hard work, and public participation. It focuses on being economically efficient. This is a short term plan deployed to achieve ‘purchase-to-sales’. </p>
            <p class="content-text">In Linear Economy, the use of natural raw materials is the most for making different products which indirectly reduces the quantity of these natural materials and resources. This leads to the overuse of natural resources and also becomes the reason for the extinction of these non-renewable resources.</p>
            <p class="content-text">The benefits of linear economy being; supports a nation’s economic growth and environmental sustainability, positive impact on business organizations and on the environment.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Circular economy:</h2>
            <img class="content-img" src="./images/disposal_2.png" alt="hazardous_img1">
            <p class="content-text">Circular economy follows the reduce-reuse-recycle strategy. It focuses on being environment friendly. This is a long term plan deployed to achieve ‘multiple cycles’ of a product.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Even though business organizations confront several obstacles in re-establishing their supply chains for the circular economy it is a quite difficult job for them to execute the whole chain of the circular economy. It is strenuous to replace the use of raw materials with recycled products, and the main task for the brand owners, producers, importers, and manufacturers is to deal with post-consumer plastic waste, it is a difficult procedure for them to collect this waste.</p>
            <p class="content-text">The benefits of circular economy being; lessens the use of non-renewable or natural resources, releases the least amount of carbon footprints into the environment, focuses on the objective of Zero Environmental Wastage, provides a wide scope of opportunities for companies.</p>
